# GAME-DEVELOPMENT-FOR-ORGAN-DONATION
This is a game I developed along with my friend who made all the sprites. We developed this project for an NGO to spread awarness about organ donation. 
It was a part of Service Learning curriculum where we have to help our society by using our appropriate skills.
I smile big and wide for being fortunate to work for well being of our society.
