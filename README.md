# GAME-DEVELOPMENT-ON-ORGAN-DONATION
It is a game I developed along with my friend who made all the sprites. We developed this project for an NGO to spread awareness about organ donation. It was a part of the Service Learning curriculum, where we have to help our society by using our appropriate skills. I smile big and full for being fortunate to work for well being of our community.
